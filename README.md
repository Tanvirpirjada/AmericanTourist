Title: Building a Responsive American Tourist Web Page with HTML and CSS

# Introduction:
As a web developer, I created an engaging American tourist web page using HTML and CSS. My goal was to design a visually appealing and responsive platform that showcases the diverse attractions and destinations across the United States.

# Key Elements:

HTML Structure: Utilized HTML5 tags for a semantic structure, improving accessibility and SEO.

Design and Layout: Implemented CSS to customize the appearance and layout of the web page.

Color Scheme: Used patriotic colors to evoke national pride and familiarity.

Typography: Carefully selected fonts for readability and hierarchy of content.

Responsive Layout: Created a responsive design using CSS media queries for optimal viewing on different devices.

# Content and Features:

# Header:
The header section of the web page contains the website logo and a navigation menu that allows users to easily navigate through the different sections.

# Main Sections:
The main section is divided into 13 subsections, each featuring its own content and properties. These sections showcase various American destinations, activities, events, and resources. Each subsection includes both code(code you can get from index.html file) snippets and images for a better understanding of the implemented features.
